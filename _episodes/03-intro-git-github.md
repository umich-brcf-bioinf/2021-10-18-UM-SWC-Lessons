## Background
_[Back to top](#contents)_

We'll start by exploring how version control can be used
to keep track of what one person did and when.
Even if you aren't collaborating with other people,
automated version control is much better than this situation:

[![Piled Higher and Deeper by Jorge Cham, http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive_print.php?comicid=1531]({{ page.root }}/fig/git/phd101212s.png)](http://www.phdcomics.com)

"Piled Higher and Deeper" by Jorge Cham, http://www.phdcomics.com

We've all been in this situation before: it seems ridiculous to have
multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document. Some word
processors let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft
Word's
[Track Changes](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Track-changes-in-Word-197ba630-0f5f-4a8e-9a77-3712475e806a),
Google Docs' [version history](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843?hl=en), or
LibreOffice's [Recording and Displaying Changes](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Recording_and_Displaying_Changes).

Version control systems start with a base version of the document and
then record changes you make each step of the way. You can
think of it as a recording of your progress: you can rewind to start at the base
document and play back each change you made, eventually arriving at your
more recent version.

![Changes Are Saved Sequentially]({{ page.root }}/fig/git/play-changes.svg)

Once you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you
can then think about "playing back" different sets of changes on the base document, ultimately
resulting in different versions of that document. For example, two users can make independent
sets of changes on the same document.

![Different Versions Can be Saved]({{ page.root }}/fig/git/versions.svg)

Unless multiple users make changes to the same section of the document - a conflict - you can
incorporate two sets of changes into the same base document.

![Multiple Versions Can be Merged]({{ page.root }}/fig/git/merge.svg)

A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us,
effectively creating different versions of our files. It allows us to decide
which changes will be made to the next version (each record of these changes is
called a [commit]({{ page.root }}{% link reference.md %}#commit)), and keeps useful metadata
about them. The complete history of commits for a particular project and their
metadata make up a [repository]({{ page.root }}{% link reference.md %}#repository).
Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers, facilitating
collaboration among different people.

## Setting up Git
_[Back to top](#contents)_

When we use Git on a new computer for the first time,
we need to configure a few things. Below are a few examples
of configurations we will set as we get started with Git:

*   our name and email address,
*   what our preferred text editor is,
*   and that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project).

On a command line, Git commands are written as `git verb options`,
where `verb` is what we actually want to do and `options` is additional optional information which may be needed for the `verb`. So here is how
Riley sets up their new laptop:

```
$ git config --global user.name "Riley Shor"
$ git config --global user.email "Riley.Shor@fake.email.address"
```
{: .language-bash}

Please use your own name and email address instead of Riley's.
This user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity,
which means that any changes pushed to
[GitHub](https://github.com/),
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/),
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or
another Git host server
in a later lesson will include this information.

For these lessons, we will be interacting with [GitHub](https://github.com/) and so the email address used should be the same as the one used when setting up your GitHub account. If you are concerned about privacy, please review [GitHub's instructions for keeping your email address private][git-privacy].

> ## GitHub, GitLab, & BitBucket
>
> GitHub, GitLab, & BitBucket are websites where you can store your git
> repositories, share them with the world, and collaborate with others.
> You can think of them like email applications. You may have a gmail address,
> and you can choose to manage your email through one of many services such as
> the Gmail app, Microsoft Outlook, Apple's Mail app, etc.
> They have different interfaces and features, but all of them allow you to
> manage your email. Similarly, GitHub, GitLab, & BitBucket have different
> interfaces and features, but they all allow you to store, share, and
> collaborate with others on your git repos.

This optional setting will make a downstream step with GitHub a bit clearer.

```
$ git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```
{: .language-bash}

Riley also has to set their favorite text editor, nano.

```
$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"
```
{: .language-bash}

Git can be configured to support most text editors. You can reconfigure the text editor for Git whenever you want to change it.

| Editor             | Configuration command                            |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| Atom | `$ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"`|
| nano               | `$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"`    |
| BBEdit (Mac, with command line tools) | `$ git config --global core.editor "bbedit -w"`    |
| Sublime Text (Mac) | `$ git config --global core.editor "/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl -n -w"` |
| Sublime Text (Win, 32-bit install) | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"` |
| Sublime Text (Win, 64-bit install) | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"` |
| Notepad (Win)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "c:/Windows/System32/notepad.exe"`|
| Notepad++ (Win, 32-bit install)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`|
| Notepad++ (Win, 64-bit install)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`|
| Kate (Linux)       | `$ git config --global core.editor "kate"`       |
| Gedit (Linux)      | `$ git config --global core.editor "gedit --wait --new-window"`   |
| Scratch (Linux)       | `$ git config --global core.editor "scratch-text-editor"`  |
| Emacs              | `$ git config --global core.editor "emacs"`   |
| Vim                | `$ git config --global core.editor "vim"`   |
| VS Code                | `$ git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`   |


Vim is the default editor. If did not change your editor and stuck in this editor, the following instructions will help you exit.

> ## Exiting Vim
>
> Note that Vim is the default editor for many programs. If you haven't used Vim before and wish to exit a session without saving
your changes, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> then type `:q!` and hit <kbd>Return</kbd>.
> If you want to save your changes and quit, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> then type `:wq` and hit <kbd>Return</kbd>.
{: .callout}

The four commands we just ran above only need to be run once: the flag `--global` tells Git
to use the settings for every project, in your user account, on this computer.

You can check your settings at any time:

```
$ git config --list
```
{: .language-bash}

You can change your configuration as many times as you want: use the
same commands to choose another editor or update your email address.

> ## Proxy
>
> In some networks you need to use a
> [proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server). If this is the case, you
> may also need to tell Git about the proxy:
>
> ```
> $ git config --global http.proxy proxy-url
> $ git config --global https.proxy proxy-url

> {: .language-bash}
>
> To disable the proxy, use
>
> ```
> $ git config --global --unset http.proxy
> $ git config --global --unset https.proxy
> ```
> {: .language-bash}
{: .callout}

> {: .language-bash}
>
> While viewing the manual, remember the `:` is a prompt waiting for commands and you can press <kbd>Q</kbd> to exit the manual.

## Creating a Repository
_[Back to top](#contents)_

Once Git is configured, we can start using it.


First, let's make sure we are in our `un-report` directory, if not we need to move into that directory:

```
$ pwd
```
{: .language-bash}

```
$ /home/USERNAME/Desktop/un-report
```
{: .output}

> To get back to your `un-report` directory you can use the following command:
>
>Mac/git-bash:
>```
>cd ~/Desktop/un-report
>```
>{: .language-bash}
>
> On Windows' Unix subsystem for Linux:
>```
>cd c/USERNAME/Desktop/un-report
>```
>{: .language-bask}
{: .callout}

What is currently in our directory?

```
$ ls
```
{: .language-bash}

```
code    data    figures
```
{: .output}


Now we tell Git to make `un-report` a [repository]({{ page.root }}{% link reference.md %}#repository)
-- a place where Git can store versions of our files:


```
$ git init
```
{: .language-bash}

It is important to note that `git init` will create a repository that
includes subdirectories and their files---there is no need to create
separate repositories nested within the `un-report` repository, whether
subdirectories are present from the beginning or added later. Also, note
that the creation of the `un-report` directory and its initialization as a
repository are completely separate processes.

If we use `ls` to show the directory's contents,
it appears that nothing has changed:

```
$ ls
```
{: .language-bash}

But if we add the `-a` flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within `un-report` called `.git`:

```
$ ls -a
```
{: .language-bash}

```
.	..	.git	code	data	figures
```
{: .output}

Git uses this special subdirectory to store all the information about the project,
including all files and sub-directories located within the project's directory.
If we ever delete the `.git` subdirectory,
we will lose the project's history.

We can check that everything is set up correctly
by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:

```
$ git status
```
{: .language-bash}
```
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
{: .output}

If you are using a different version of `git`, the exact
wording of the output might be slightly different.

## Tracking Changes
_[Back to top](#contents)_

Let's make sure we're still in the right directory.
You should be in the `un-report` directory.

```
$ cd ~/Desktop/un-report
```
{: .language-bash}

Let's create a file called `notes.txt`. We'll write some notes about the plot we
have made so far -- later we'll add more details about the project. We'll use
`nano` to edit the file; you can use whatever text editor you like.

```
$ nano notes.txt
```
{: .language-bash}

Type the text below into the `notes.txt` file:

```
We plotted life expectancy over time.
```

Let's first verify that the file was properly created by running the list command (`ls`):


```
$ ls
```
{: .language-bash}

```
notes.txt
```
{: .output}


`notes.txt` contains a single line, which we can see by running:

```
$ cat notes.txt
```
{: .language-bash}

```
We plotted life expectancy over time.
```
{: .output}

If we check the status of our project again,
Git tells us that it's noticed the new file:

```
$ git status
```
{: .language-bash}

```
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	notes.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
{: .output}

The "untracked files" message means that there's a file in the directory
that Git isn't keeping track of.
We can tell Git to track a file using `git add`:

```
$ git add notes.txt
```
{: .language-bash}

and then check that the right thing happened:

```
$ git status
```
{: .language-bash}

```
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   notes.txt

```
{: .output}

Git now knows that it's supposed to keep track of `notes.txt`,
but it hasn't recorded these changes as a commit yet.
To get it to do that,
we need to run one more command:

```
$ git commit -m "Start notes on analysis"
```
{: .language-bash}

```
[master (root-commit) f22b25e] Start notes on analysis
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 notes.txt
```
{: .output}

When we run `git commit`,
Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add`
and stores a copy permanently inside the special `.git` directory.
This permanent copy is called a [commit]({{ page.root }}{% link reference.md %}#commit)
(or [revision]({{ page.root }}{% link reference.md %}#revision)) and its short identifier is `f22b25e`. Your commit may have another identifier.

We use the `-m` flag (for "message")
to record a short, descriptive, and specific comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why.
If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option,
Git will launch `nano` (or whatever other editor we configured as `core.editor`)
so that we can write a longer message.

[Good commit messages][commit-messages] start with a brief (<50 characters) statement about the
changes made in the commit. Generally, the message should complete the sentence "If applied, this commit will" <commit message here>.
If you want to go into more detail, add a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes. Use this additional space to explain why you made changes and/or what their impact will be.

If we run `git status` now:

```
$ git status
```
{: .language-bash}

```
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```
{: .output}

it tells us everything is up to date.
If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can ask Git to show us the project's history using `git log`:

```
$ git log
```
{: .language-bash}

```
commit f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b
Author: Riley Shor <Riley.Shor@fake.email.address>
Date:   Thu Aug 22 09:51:46 2020 -0400

    Start notes on analysis
```
{: .output}

`git log` lists all commits  made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes
the commit's full identifier
(which starts with the same characters as
the short identifier printed by the `git commit` command earlier),
the commit's author,
when it was created,
and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.

> ## Where Are My Changes?
>
> If we run `ls` at this point, we will still see just one file called `notes.txt`.
> That's because Git saves information about files' history
> in the special `.git` directory mentioned earlier
> so that our filesystem doesn't become cluttered
> (and so that we can't accidentally edit or delete an old version).
{: .callout}

Now suppose Riley adds more information to the file.
(Again, we'll edit with `nano` and then `cat` the file to show its contents;
you may use a different editor, and don't need to `cat`.)

```
$ nano notes.txt
$ cat notes.txt
```
{: .language-bash}

```
We plotted life expectancy over time.
Each point represents a country.
```
{: .output}

When we run `git status` now,
it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:

```
$ git status
```
{: .language-bash}

```
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   notes.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
{: .output}

The last line is the key phrase:
"no changes added to commit".
We have changed this file,
but we haven't told Git we will want to save those changes
(which we do with `git add`)
nor have we saved them (which we do with `git commit`).
So let's do that now. It is good practice to always review
our changes before saving them. We do this using `git diff`.
This shows us the differences between the current state
of the file and the most recently saved version:

```
$ git diff
```
{: .language-bash}

```
diff --git a/notes.txt b/notes.txt
index df0654a..315bf3a 100644
--- a/notes.txt
+++ b/notes.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 We plotted life expectancy over time.
+Each point represents a country.
```
{: .output}

The output is cryptic because
it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and `patch`
telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other.
If we break it down into pieces:

1.  The first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix `diff` command
    comparing the old and new versions of the file.
2.  The second line tells exactly which versions of the file
    Git is comparing;
    `df0654a` and `315bf3a` are unique computer-generated labels for those versions.
3.  The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.
4.  The remaining lines are the most interesting, they show us the actual differences
    and the lines on which they occur.
    In particular,
    the `+` marker in the first column shows where we added a line.

After reviewing our change, it's time to commit it:

```
$ git commit -m "Add information on points"
$ git status
```
{: .language-bash}

```
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   notes.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
{: .output}

Whoops:
Git won't commit because we didn't use `git add` first.
Let's fix that:

```
$ git add notes.txt
$ git commit -m "Add information on points"
```
{: .language-bash}

```
[master 34961b1] Add information on points
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```
{: .output}

Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit
before actually committing anything. This allows us to commit our
changes in stages and capture changes in logical portions rather than
only large batches.
For example,
suppose we're adding a few citations to relevant research to our thesis.
We might want to commit those additions,
and the corresponding bibliography entries,
but *not* commit some of our work drafting the conclusion
(which we haven't finished yet).

To allow for this,
Git has a special *staging area*
where it keeps track of things that have been added to
the current [changeset]({{ page.root }}{% link reference.md %}#changeset)
but not yet committed.

> ## Staging Area
>
> If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project,

![The Git Staging Area]({{ page.root }}/fig/git/git-staging-area.svg)

Let's watch as our changes to a file move from our editor
to the staging area
and into long-term storage.
First,
we'll add another line to the file:

```
$ nano notes.txt
$ cat notes.txt
```
{: .language-bash}

```
We plotted life expectancy over time.
Each point represents a country.
Continents are grouped by color.
```

```
$ git diff

{: .language-bash}

```

--- a/notes.txt
+++ b/notes.txt
@@ -1,2 +1,3 @@

 Each point represents a country.
+Continents are grouped by color.
```
{: .output}

So far, so good:
we've added one line to the end of the file
(shown with a `+` in the first column).
Now let's put that change in the staging area
and see what `git diff` reports:

```
$ git add notes.txt
$ git diff
```
{: .language-bash}

There is no output:
as far as Git can tell,
there's no difference between what it's been asked to save permanently
and what's currently in the directory.
However,
if we do this:

```
$ git diff --staged
```
{: .language-bash}

```
diff --git a/notes.txt b/notes.txt

it shows us the difference between
the last committed change
and what's in the staging area.
Let's save our changes:

```
$ git commit -m "Add note about point color"
```
{: .language-bash}

```

check our status:

```

and look at the history of what we've done so far:

To recap, when we want to add changes to our repository,
we first need to add the changed files to the staging area
(`git add`) and then commit the staged changes to the
repository (`git commit`):

## Intro to GitHub
_[Back to top](#contents)_

Now that you've created a git repo and gotten the hang of the basic git workflow,
it's time to share your repo with the world.
Systems like Git allow us to move work between any two repositories. In
practice, though, it's easiest to use one copy as a central hub, and to keep it
on the web rather than on someone's laptop. Most programmers use hosting
services like [GitHub](https://github.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) or
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) to hold those master copies.

Let's start by sharing the changes we've made to our current project with the
world. We do this by creating a repository on GitHub and linking it to our
existing local repository. To link these, GitHub security requires you to use
either a Personal Access Token (like a limited-use password) or an SSH key
(which establishes a trusted relationship between two systems). Either way works
well; we will use the SSH approach detailed below.


### SSH Background and Setup

SSH (Secure Shell Protocol) key is commonly used by many different services to authenticate access on the command line.  SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that allows secure communication between computers using an otherwise insecure network.  

SSH uses what is called a key pair; two keys that work together to validate access. One key is publicly known (the public key), is kept private (the private key).

You can think of the public key as a padlock, and only you have the key (the private key) to open it. You use the public key where you want a secure method of communication, such as your GitHub account.  You give this padlock, or public key, to GitHub and say “lock the communications to my account with this so that only computers that have my private key can unlock communications and send git commands as my GitHub account.”  

What we will do now is the minimum required to set up the SSH keys and add the public key to a GitHub account.

> ## Advanced SSH
> See [GitHub SSH](#https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) for more details on using and configuring SSH.
{: .callout}

The first thing we are going to do is check if this has already been done on the computer you’re on.  Because generally speaking, this setup only needs to happen once and then you can forget about it.


First we execute this command to check that no SSH key is already set up in GitHub.

~~~
ssh -T git@github.com
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The first time you do this, you might see the following. When prompted answer "yes".
~~~
The authenticity of host 'github.com (192.30.255.112)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? y
Please type 'yes', 'no' or the fingerprint: yes
Warning: Permanently added 'github.com' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
~~~
{: .output}

The next line could one of the following outputs below.
~~~
Hi Riley! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
~~~
{: .output}
If you see this, then you SSH access is already set up, so you can proceed to
[Making a repository on GitHub and linking it to a local repository](#making-a-repository-on-github-and-linking-it-to-a-local-repository)

~~~
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
~~~
{: .output}
If you see this, it's ok; keep going below to set up SSH access.


> ## Keeping your keys secure
> You shouldn't really forget about your SSH keys, since they keep your account secure. It’s good
>  practice to audit your secure shell keys every so often. Especially if you are using multiple
>  computers to access your account.
{: .callout}

We will run the list command to check what key pairs already exist on your computer.

~~~
ls -al ~/.ssh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Your output is going to look a little different depending on whether or not SSH has ever been set up on the computer you are using.

Riley has not set up SSH on her computer, so her output is

~~~
ls: cannot access '/c/Users/Riley/.ssh': No such file or directory
~~~
{: .output}

If SSH has been set up on the computer you're using, the public and private key pairs will be listed. The file names are either `id_ed25519`/`id_ed25519.pub` or `id_rsa`/`id_rsa.pub` depending on how the key pairs were set up.  

Since they don’t exist on Riley’s computer, she uses this command to create them:

~~~
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "Riley.Shor@fake.email.address"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:
`$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "Riley.Shor@fake.email.address"`

~~~
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/Riley/.ssh/id_ed25519):
~~~
{: .output}

We want to use the default file, so just press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

~~~
Created directory '/c/Users/Riley/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
~~~
{: .output}

Now, it is prompting Riley for a passphrase.  Since she is using her lab’s laptop that other people sometimes have access to, she wants to create a passphrase.  Be sure to use something memorable or save your passphrase somewhere, as there is no "reset my password" option.

~~~
Enter same passphrase again:
~~~
{: .output}

After entering the same passphrase a second time, we receive the confirmation

~~~
Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/Riley/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/Riley/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:SMSPIStNyA00KPxuYu94KpZgRAYjgt9g4BA4kFy3g1o Riley.Shor@fake.email.address
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|^B== o.          |
|%*=.*.+          |
|+=.E =.+         |
| .=.+.o..        |
|....  . S        |
|.+ o             |
|+ =              |
|.o.o             |
|oo+.             |
+----[SHA256]-----+
~~~
{: .output}

The "identification" is actually the private key. You should never share it.  The public key is appropriately named.  The "key fingerprint"
is a shorter version of a public key.

Now that we have generated the SSH keys, we will find the SSH files when we check.

~~~
ls -al ~/.ssh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
drwxr-xr-x 1 Riley Shor 197121   0 Jul 16 14:48 ./
drwxr-xr-x 1 Riley Shor 197121   0 Jul 16 14:48 ../
-rw-r--r-- 1 Riley Shor 197121 419 Jul 16 14:48 id_ed25519
-rw-r--r-- 1 Riley Shor 197121 106 Jul 16 14:48 id_ed25519.pub
~~~
{: .output}

Now we that we have a public and private key pair, we need to give GitHub our public key.  
First, we need to copy the public key.  Be sure to include the `.pub` at the end, otherwise you’re looking at the private key.

### Making a repository on GitHub and linking it to a local repository
Log in to GitHub, then click on the icon in the top right corner to
create a new repository called `un-report`.

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 1)]({{ page.root }}/fig/git/github-create-repo-01.png)

Name your repository `un-report` and then click `Create Repository`.

> ## Important options
>
> Since this repository will be connected to a local repository, it needs to be empty. Leave
> "Initialize this repository with a README" unchecked, and keep "None" as options for both "Add
> .gitignore" and "Add a license." See the "GitHub License and README files" exercise below for a full
> explanation of why the repository needs to be empty.
{: .checklist}

In the screenshots below, the Owner is 'mkuzak' and the Repository name is 'planets'.
You should instead see your own username for the Owner and you should name the
repository `un-report`.

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 2)]({{ page.root }}/fig/git/github-create-repo-02.png)

As soon as the repository is created, GitHub displays a page with a URL and some
information on how to configure your local repository:

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 3)]({{ page.root }}/fig/git/github-create-repo-03.png)

This effectively does the following on GitHub's servers:

```
$ mkdir un-report
$ cd un-report
$ git init
```
{: .language-bash}

If you remember back to the earlier [lesson]({{ page.root }}/04-changes/) where we added and
committed our earlier work on `notes.txt`, we had a diagram of the local repository
which looked like this:

![The Local Repository with Git Staging Area]({{ page.root }}/fig/git/git-staging-area.svg)

Now that we have two repositories, we need a diagram like this:

![Freshly-Made GitHub Repository]({{ page.root }}/fig/git/git-freshly-made-github-repo.svg)

Note that our local repository still contains our earlier work on `notes.txt`, but the
remote repository on GitHub appears empty as it doesn't contain any files yet.

The next step is to connect the two repositories.  We do this by making the
GitHub repository a [remote]({{ page.root}}{% link reference.md %}#remote) for the local repository.
The home page of the repository on GitHub includes the string we need to
identify it:

![Where to Find Repository URL on GitHub]({{ page.root }}/fig/git/github-find-repo-string.png)

Copy that URL from the browser, go into the local `un-report` repository, and run
this command:

```
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/un-report.git
```
{: .language-bash}

Make sure to replace `USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username so it will use
the correct URL for your repository; that should be the only difference.

`origin` is a local name used to refer to the remote repository. It could be called
anything, but `origin` is a convention that is often used by default in git
and GitHub, so it's helpful to stick with this unless there's a reason not to.

We can check that the command has worked by running `git remote -v`:

```
$ git remote -v
```
{: .language-bash}

```
origin   https://github.com/USERNAME/un-report.git (push)
origin   https://github.com/USERNAME/un-report.git (fetch)
```
{: .output}

Once the remote is set up, this command will push the changes from
our local repository to the repository on GitHub:

```
$ git push origin master
```
{: .language-bash}

```

{: .callout}

We can pull changes from the remote repository to the local one as well:

```
$ git pull origin master
```

```

Pulling has no effect in this case because the two repositories are already
synchronized.  If someone else had pushed some changes to the repository on
GitHub, though, this command would download them to our local repository.

## Collaborating with GitHub
_[Back to top](#contents)_

For the next step, get into pairs.  One person will be the "Owner" and the other
will be the "Collaborator". The goal is that the Collaborator add changes into
the Owner's repository. We will switch roles at the end, so both persons will
play Owner and Collaborator.

> ## Practicing By Yourself
>
> If you're working through this lesson on your own, you can carry on by opening
> a second terminal window.
> This window will represent your partner, working on another computer. You
> won't need to give anyone access on GitHub, because both 'partners' are you.
{: .callout}

The Owner needs to give the Collaborator access. On GitHub, click the settings
button on the right, select Manage access, click Invite a collaborator, and
then enter your partner's username.

![Adding Collaborators on GitHub]({{ page.root }}/fig/git/github-add-collaborators.png)

To accept access to the Owner's repo, the Collaborator
needs to go to [https://github.com/notifications](https://github.com/notifications).
Once there she can accept access to the Owner's repo.

Next, the Collaborator needs to download a copy of the Owner's repository to her
 machine. This is called "cloning a repo". To clone the Owner's repo into
her `Desktop` folder, the Collaborator enters:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/un-report.git ~/Desktop/USERNAME-un-report
```
{: .language-bash}

Replace `USERNAME` with the Owner's username.

The Collaborator can now make a change in her clone of the Owner's repository,
exactly the same way as we've been doing before:

```
$ cd ~/Desktop/USERNAME-un-report
$ nano notes.txt
$ cat notes.txt
```
{: .language-bash}

You can write anything you like. Now might be a good time to list the
**dependencies** of the project -- the tools and packages that are needed
to run the code.
```
Dependencies:
- R >= 4.0
- tidyverse
```

```

$ git commit -m "List dependencies"
```
{: .language-bash}

```
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 notes.txt
```
{: .output}

Then push the change to the *Owner's repository* on GitHub:

```
$ git push origin master
```
{: .language-bash}

```

Counting objects: 4, done.

Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/USERNAME/un-report.git
   9272da5..29aba7c  master -> master
```
{: .output}

Note that we didn't have to create a remote called `origin`: Git uses this
name by default when we clone a repository.  (This is why `origin` was a
sensible choice earlier when we were setting up remotes by hand.)

Take a look at the Owner's repository on its GitHub website now (you may need
to refresh your browser.) You should be able to see the new commit made by the
Collaborator.

To download the Collaborator's changes from GitHub, the Owner now enters:

```
$ git pull origin master
```
{: .language-bash}

```
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.

GitHub) are back in sync!

- [Exploring History](#exploring-history)

### Exploring history

We can refer to commits by their identifiers shown in `log`. You can also refer
to the _most recent commit_ of the working directory by using the identifier
`HEAD`.

We've been adding one line at a time to `notes.txt`, so it's easy to track our
progress by looking, so let's do that using our `HEAD`s.  Before we start,
let's make a change to `notes.txt`, adding yet another line.

```
$ nano notes.txt
$ cat notes.txt
```
{: .language-bash}

```
We plotted life expectancy over time.
Each point represents a country.
Continents are grouped by color.
An ill-considered change.
```
{: .output}

Now, let's see what we get.

```
$ git diff HEAD notes.txt
```
{: .language-bash}

```
diff --git a/notes.txt b/notes.txt
index b36abfd..0848c8d 100644

+++ b/notes.txt
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
 We plotted life expectancy over time.
 Each point represents a country.
 Continents are grouped by color.
+An ill-considered change.
```
{: .output}

which is the same as what you would get if you leave out `HEAD` (try it).  The
real goodness in all this is when you can refer to previous commits.  We do
that by adding `~1`
(where "~" is "tilde", pronounced [**til**-d*uh*])
to refer to the commit one before `HEAD`.

```
$ git diff HEAD~1 notes.txt
```
{: .language-bash}

If we want to see the differences between older commits we can use `git diff`
again, but with the notation `HEAD~1`, `HEAD~2`, and so on, to refer to them:

```
$ git diff HEAD~3 notes.txt
```
{: .language-bash}

```
diff --git a/notes.txt b/notes.txt

We could also use `git show` which shows us what changes we made at an older commit as
well as the commit message, rather than the _differences_ between a commit and our
working directory that we see by using `git diff`.

```
$ git show HEAD~3 notes.txt

{: .output}

In this way,
we can build up a chain of commits.
The most recent end of the chain is referred to as `HEAD`;
we can refer to previous commits using the `~` notation,
so `HEAD~1`
means "the previous commit",
while `HEAD~123` goes back 123 commits from where we are now.

We can also refer to commits using
those long strings of digits and letters
that `git log` displays.
These are unique IDs for the changes,
and "unique" really does mean unique:
every change to any set of files on any computer
has a unique 40-character identifier.
Our first commit was given the ID
`f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b`,
so let's try this:

```
$ git diff f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b notes.txt
```
{: .language-bash}

That's the right answer,
but typing out random 40-character strings is annoying,
so Git lets us use just the first few characters (typically seven for normal size projects):

```
$ git diff f22b25e notes.txt
```
{: .language-bash}

All right! So
we can save changes to files and see what we've changed. Now, how
can we restore older versions of things?
Let's suppose we change our mind about the last update to
`notes.txt` (the "ill-considered change").

`git status` now tells us that the file has been changed,
but those changes haven't been staged:

```
$ git status
```
{: .language-bash}

```
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   notes.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
{: .output}

We can put things back the way they were
by using `git checkout`:

```
$ git checkout HEAD notes.txt
$ cat notes.txt
```
{: .language-bash}

```
We plotted life expectancy over time.
Each point represents a country.
Continents are grouped by color.
```
{: .output}

As you might guess from its name,
`git checkout` checks out (i.e., restores) an old version of a file.
In this case,
we're telling Git that we want to recover the version of the file recorded in `HEAD`,
which is the last saved commit.
If we want to go back even further,
we can use a commit identifier instead:

```
$ git checkout f22b25e notes.txt
```
{: .language-bash}

```
$ cat notes.txt
```
{: .language-bash}

```
 We plotted life expectancy over time.

  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

```
{: .output}

Notice that the changes are currently in the staging area.
Again, we can put things back the way they were
by using `git checkout`:

```
$ git checkout HEAD notes.txt

{: .callout}

It's important to remember that
we must use the commit number that identifies the state of the repository
*before* the change we're trying to undo.
A common mistake is to use the number of
the commit in which we made the change we're trying to discard.
In the example below, we want to retrieve the state from before the most
recent commit (`HEAD~1`), which is commit `f22b25e`:

![Git Checkout]({{ page.root }}/fig/git/git-checkout.svg)

We have now reverted our current file and commit to the latest version without the bug. But we have kept the commit and history from the commit that had the error.

The fact that files can be reverted one by one
tends to change the way people organize their work.
If everything is in one large document,
it's hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction
without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion.
If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files,
on the other hand,
moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.
